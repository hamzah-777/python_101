A literal is a data value that appears directly in a program
Identifiers=
In PHP, identifiers are used to name variables, functions, constants, and classes.
Keywords=
A word reserved by the language for its core functionalityâ€”you cannot 
give a variable, function, class, or constant the same name as 
a keyword. Case insensitive in PHP.

<p>PHP has three different variable scopes: <br>
local <br>
global <br>
static</p>

<p>A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:</p>

<p>PHP also stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS[index]. The index holds the name of the variable. This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables directly.</p>

<p>Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job. <br>
To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable: <br>
The variable is still local to the function. but it retain value between func calls (works like a global variable)</p>

<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
  $GLOBALS['y'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
}

myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
?>
